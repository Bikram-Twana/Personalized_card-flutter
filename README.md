This Flutter app is about your personal details.

For this project I use different types of widgets like: 
Layout widgets such as containers, columns and rows, but also customizable widgets such as a circle avatar or the card widget or list tile. 
we used the documentation to see what properties of these widgets we can set and customize them to our liking and implied some custom fonts and icons to make our design. 

Font used: Lobste-Regular, Pacifico-Regular, Source Sans Pro


This is how app looks like:
